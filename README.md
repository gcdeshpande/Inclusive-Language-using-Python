# Text and speech analysis for Inclusivity 

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## 👉🏻 Solution
Hence Inclusive language plays an important role here. Inclusive language simply means a language that is inclusive to each and everyone in the society regardless of their culture, race, gender, economic background, sexual orientation.

## 🙋🏻 Overview
Our aim is to create a tool that has the ability to identify exclusionary words and suggest appropriate corresponding inclusive words for the same. Creating an inclusive environment not only supports employees’ emotional well-being, but also improves their productivity, and therefore contributes to the overall success of an organization. As far as the benefits go, inclusive language amplifies your message and relates it to a wider audience. It also signals to people and communities who have been historically marginalized that they’re safe to be themselves at work.


## 💎 Features
