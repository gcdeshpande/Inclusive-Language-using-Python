# Text and speech analysis for Inclusivity 

## 🤩 Motivation
Language has the power to make or break a conversation, both verbal and written. It is very important to use the right set of words when we do so. Sometimes unintentionally we may use words that are offensive to a certain group of people. The way we talk or express ourselves can cause others to feel uncomfortable, misunderstood, or excluded. These exclusions can be with respect to gender, race, color, physical abilities, ethnicity, religion, caste, job roles, and so on.


## 👉🏻 Solution
Hence Inclusive language plays an important role here. Inclusive language simply means a language that is inclusive to each and everyone in the society regardless of their culture, race, gender, economic background, sexual orientation.

## 🙋🏻 Overview
Our aim is to create a tool that has the ability to identify exclusionary words and suggest appropriate corresponding inclusive words for the same. Creating an inclusive environment not only supports employees’ emotional well-being, but also improves their productivity, and therefore contributes to the overall success of an organization. As far as the benefits go, inclusive language amplifies your message and relates it to a wider audience. It also signals to people and communities who have been historically marginalized that they’re safe to be themselves at work.


## 💎 Features
•	Custom dataset which will be open source and keep constantly evolving.

•	Our tool will be designed to take all kinds of input(ppt, pptx, txt, doc, pdf, png, and jpeg files).

•	Our tool will also be able to identify exclusive terms in audio files and suggest and replace them with appropriate inclusive terms.
 
•	We wish to analyze the text written in Regional languages like Hindi, Marathi, Kannada and suggest alternate inclusive language terms.

## 👉🏻 Frameworks and packages we will use
•	Spacy and textacy libraries of python for NLP.

•	SpeechRecognition, PyTesseract, and EasyOCR Libraries.

•	StreamLit to build the UI.

•	Django and Flask.
